# JDK Manager

A cross-platform command-line tool for managing multiple Java Development Kit (JDK) versions, similar to nvm for Node.js.

## üöÄ Features

- **Easy Installation**: Download and install JDKs from Eclipse Adoptium with a single command
- **Version Switching**: Seamlessly switch between different JDK versions
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Environment Management**: Automatically handles JAVA_HOME and PATH configuration
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for downloads
- **Version Listing**: List installed and available JDK versions
- **LTS Support**: Easy identification of Long Term Support versions

## üì¶ Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jdk-manager.git
cd jdk-manager
go build -o jdk main.go
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/your-username/jdk-manager@latest
```

## üîß Usage

### List Available JDK Versions

```bash
# List all available versions
jdk list-remote

# List only LTS versions
jdk list-remote --lts

# List all versions including pre-releases
jdk list-remote --all
```

### Install a JDK Version

```bash
# Install latest JDK 21
jdk install 21

# Install specific version
jdk install 17.0.8

# Force reinstall
jdk install 21 --force
```

### List Installed Versions

```bash
jdk list
```

### Switch JDK Version

```bash
# Switch to JDK 21
jdk use 21

# Switch to specific version
jdk use 17.0.8
```

The \`use\` command will output the necessary environment variable commands. Run them to activate the JDK:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/home/user/.jdks/21"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\\Users\\user\\.jdks\\21"
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\\bin;$env:PATH"
```

### Get Help

```bash
jdk --help
jdk install --help
```

## üìÅ Directory Structure

JDKs are installed in \`~/.jdks/\` directory:

```
~/.jdks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 21/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 17.0.8/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 11/
